## Time Series 

_Time Series Analysis_

We have discussed on following topics:
1) Usage of **datetime** module
2) How to convert dates in strings into datetime object and vice versa
3) Learn about pandas **timestamp** object along with **date_range** and explore different frequencies.
4) **Plotting** and **Slicing** time series 
5) Learn about why we need resmapling and perform different techniques in resampling i.e. **Upsampling** and **Downsampling**
6) Dig dive into **timezones** and convert from one from to another. 
7) Usage of **timedelta** to perfome basic arthimatic operation.


_Time Series Vaildation_ 

We have discussed about following techniques:
1) Hold Out Validation
2) Time Series Cross Validation
3) Walk Forward Cross Validation
